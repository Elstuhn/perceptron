Experimenting with perceptrons for different uses


## About
**A perceptron is a type of artificial neural network that is used for binary classification tasks. It was developed in the 1950s by Frank Rosenblatt and consists of a single layer of artificial neurons, each of which receives input from multiple other neurons and generates a binary output signal based on the input it receives. The output of each neuron is determined by a set of weights, which represent the strength of the connections between the neurons. These weights are adjusted based on the input data and the desired output, allowing the perceptron to learn and adapt to new data over time. Despite its limitations, the perceptron remains an important building block of modern machine learning algorithms and continues to be used in a wide range of applications.**
